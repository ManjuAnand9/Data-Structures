# Implemented Brute Force, Boyer-Moore-Horspool Algorithm and  Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm


Pattern matching is the process of determining whether a given sequence of
the pattern is present in the given Text. In contrast to pattern recognition, the match
usually has to be exact: "either it will or will not be a match. The Pattern Searching
algorithms are sometimes also referred to as String Searching Algorithms and are
considered as a part of the String algorithms. These algorithms are useful in the case of
searching a string within another string. Among the Pattern matching algorithms,I have
considered the below three algorithms in the Project:
1. Brute Force
2. Boyer-Moore-Horspool Algorithm
3. Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm
